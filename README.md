## Good mornin', COFFEEE!??!

Vivere Kaffettino is a **Telegram application** that allows the members of the University of Palermo, belonging to the **Vivere Ingegneria** association, to **pay for their coffee in an easy, fast, and intuitive way**.

## How does it work?

An **ESP8266** scans an **NFC card** previously assigned to a user. If their balance is positive (or slightly negative), it deducts the cost of the coffee. The card is then recharged by an administrator.

## Warehouse Management

If there is no coffee left in the warehouse, **it sends a notification to the administrator**, preventing further coffee credits.

## Not just coffee!

The application was **created for coffee**, but that doesn't mean we have to **limit** ourselves to it! You can stock water bottles, snacks, and much more in the "warehouse." **The only limit is your imagination!**

## Documentation (WIP)

All the **administrative and user documentation** is located under the [Docs](./Docs) folder.
